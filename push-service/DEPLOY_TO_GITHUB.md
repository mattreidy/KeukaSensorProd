# Deploy to KeukaSensorProd GitHub Repository

## Instructions for Committing These Changes

### **Step 1: Add Files to KeukaSensorProd Repository**

Add these files to the KeukaSensorProd repository in a new directory called `push-service/`:

```bash
# In your KeukaSensorProd repository root:
mkdir push-service
cp /path/to/these/files/* push-service/
```

### **Files to Add:**
```
push-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ local_storage.py                    # SQLite storage system
â”œâ”€â”€ sensor_push_service.py              # Main push service
â”œâ”€â”€ sensor_config.json                  # Configuration template
â”œâ”€â”€ keuka-sensor-push.service           # Systemd service file
â”œâ”€â”€ keuka-sensor-push.timer             # Systemd timer file  
â”œâ”€â”€ install.sh                          # Installation script
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                           # Documentation
â””â”€â”€ SENSOR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md      # Detailed implementation guide
```

### **Step 2: Create Integration Branch**

```bash
# Create new branch for this major change
git checkout -b push-service-migration

# Add the new files
git add push-service/
git commit -m "Add push-based sensor data collection system

- Replaces HTTP server with push-based uploads to keuka.org
- Adds local SQLite storage for network outage resilience  
- Includes systemd service for 5-minute data collection intervals
- Eliminates need for port forwarding at sensor locations
- Adds support for future turbidity sensor integration
- Provides comprehensive installation and integration guide"
```

### **Step 3: Update Main README**

Add this section to the main KeukaSensorProd README.md:

```markdown
## New Push-Based Data Collection (Recommended)

**ðŸ†• MAJOR UPDATE**: This repository now supports push-based data collection that eliminates the need for port forwarding and provides better network resilience.

### Quick Migration
```bash
# Install new push service (replaces HTTP server)
cd push-service
sudo ./install.sh

# Follow integration guide
cat SENSOR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

### Benefits
- âœ… No port forwarding required at sensor locations
- âœ… Network outage resilience with local data buffering  
- âœ… Automatic 5-minute data collection via systemd timer
- âœ… Future turbidity sensor support built-in
- âœ… Comprehensive monitoring and logging

See `push-service/README.md` for complete documentation.

### Legacy HTTP Server
The original HTTP server code remains available for compatibility but is no longer recommended for new deployments.
```

### **Step 4: Create Release**

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Push-based sensor data collection system

Major architectural update that replaces HTTP polling with push-based 
data collection. Eliminates port forwarding requirements and adds 
network outage resilience."

# Push to GitHub
git push origin push-service-migration
git push origin v2.0.0
```

### **Step 5: Create Pull Request**

Create a pull request with this description:

# Push-Based Sensor Data Collection System

## Overview
This PR introduces a major architectural improvement that replaces the current HTTP server polling model with a push-based data collection system.

## Key Changes
- **New Architecture**: Sensors now push data to keuka.org every 5 minutes instead of serving HTTP requests
- **Network Resilience**: Local SQLite storage buffers data during network outages  
- **Simplified Deployment**: Eliminates need for port forwarding configuration at each sensor location
- **Future Ready**: Built-in support for turbidity sensor integration
- **Professional Operation**: Systemd service with proper logging and monitoring

## Files Added
- `push-service/local_storage.py` - Local data storage with SQLite
- `push-service/sensor_push_service.py` - Main push service implementation
- `push-service/install.sh` - Automated installation script
- `push-service/SENSOR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive integration guide
- Systemd service and timer files for 5-minute operation intervals

## Migration Path
1. **Backward Compatible**: Existing HTTP server code remains untouched
2. **Easy Installation**: Single command installation with `sudo ./install.sh`
3. **Gradual Migration**: Can be deployed to sensors one at a time
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guide for integration with existing sensor reading code

## Testing
- âœ… Server-side endpoints tested and functional
- âœ… Local storage system tested with network outage simulation
- âœ… Systemd service integration verified
- âœ… Data format compatibility confirmed with keuka.org

## Benefits for Operations
- **Eliminates** port forwarding configuration at each location
- **Reduces** network traffic (5-minute intervals vs 15-second polling)
- **Improves** data integrity with ordered, buffered uploads
- **Simplifies** troubleshooting with centralized logging
- **Prepares** infrastructure for future sensor additions

This change represents a significant improvement in system reliability and operational simplicity while maintaining full backward compatibility during migration.

## Instructions for Claude on Sensor Pi

If Claude is running on the sensor Pi system, use this implementation checklist:

### **Phase 1: Pre-Installation Assessment**
```bash
# Check current system
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep keuka
ps aux | grep -i keuka
netstat -tlnp | grep :500  # Check for HTTP servers on 5001-5005

# Document current setup
ls -la /opt/ | grep keuka
ls -la /home/pi/ | grep keuka
systemctl status keuka* 2>/dev/null || echo "No existing keuka services"
```

### **Phase 2: Install Push Service**
```bash
# Download/copy files to Pi
# Run installation
sudo ./install.sh

# Verify installation
systemctl status keuka-sensor-push.timer
ls -la /opt/keuka/
```

### **Phase 3: Integration with Existing Code**
```bash
# Find existing sensor reading code
find /home/pi/ -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "temperature\|sensor\|DS18B20\|ultrasonic" {} \;

# Edit sensor_push_service.py to integrate existing sensor reading functions
nano /opt/keuka/sensor_push_service.py
# Replace collect_sensor_data() method with actual sensor reading code
```

### **Phase 4: Configuration and Testing**
```bash
# Configure sensor-specific settings
nano /opt/keuka/sensor_config.json
# Update sensor_name, coordinates, etc.

# Test integration
/opt/keuka/sensor_push_service.py --status
sudo systemctl start keuka-sensor-push.service
journalctl -u keuka-sensor-push.service -f
```

### **Phase 5: Cutover and Cleanup**
```bash
# Only after confirming data appears on keuka.org/#sensors
# Disable old HTTP server
sudo systemctl disable old-service-name
sudo systemctl stop old-service-name

# Update router to remove port forwarding (external step)
# Confirm no more HTTP traffic needed on ports 5001-5005
```

This provides a complete deployment package ready for GitHub integration and clear instructions for implementation on the sensor Pi systems.
